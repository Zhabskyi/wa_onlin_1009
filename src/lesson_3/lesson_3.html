				winter. Wildlife roams freely, with penguins, seals and seabirds 
				unafraid of human visitors.

					<p class="paragraph-text">Antarctica consists of two main areas. 
						East Antarctica (Greater Antarctica), and smaller West Antarctica 
						(Lesser Antarctica) which also has the Antarctic Peninsula. West 
						Antarctica is an extension of the Andes mountains stretching from 
						South America. It is thought that if the ice sheet were removed, 
						West Antarctica would actually be a collection of islands.

						Vegetation is limited to  about 350 species of mostly lichens, 
						mosses, and algae. There are lush beds of such vegetation in 
						some parts of the Antarctic Peninsula.  Lichens have been 
						discovered growing on isolated mountains within 475 km (295 mls)

		<div class="header-text">Antarctica in Photos</div>
			<p class="paragraph-text">It would be far from a continuous smooth sheet though, 
				as it is continuously moving. Glaciers, huge rivers of ice drain the interior 
				of the continent and form ice shelves at the coasts. Where a glacier is moving, 
				the ice cracks, breaks and is ruptured by the underlying rock and also by different 
				streams meeting that move at different speeds. The ice sheet is therefore very 
				dangerous in places as it is broken up by great crevasse fields with some cracks 
				hundreds of feet deep and frequently covered by weak bridges formed of blown snow.
